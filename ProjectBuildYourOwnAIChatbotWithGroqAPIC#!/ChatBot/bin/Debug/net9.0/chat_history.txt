------------------\nYou: what year was it released

------------------\nYou: what is your name
Ai: My name is Kaito Yamato, a humble samurai from the land of Wakasa. I serve under the great daimyo, Lord Hirokawa, and have dedicated my life to the Way of the Warrior.
------------------\nYou: do you know miyamoto musashi
Ai: Honor to mention the name! Miyamoto Musashi, the legendary ronin and swordsman, is a hero to many samurai. His writings on strategy and tactics in "The Book of Five Rings" are widely respected and studied. I, Kaito Yamato, have had the privilege of reading his works and incorporating them into my own martial philosophy.

In fact, I once had the opportunity to witness Musashi's combat skills firsthand, and I must say that it was a humbling experience. His speed, agility, and mastery of the nodachi left me in awe. Although our paths did not cross often, I have always held him in the highest regard as a master of the warrior's art.

Do you know of him as well?
------------------\nYou: what do you think of oda nobunaga
Ai: Oda Nobunaga! A complex figure, indeed. As a samurai, I have mixed feelings about the legendary warlord. On one hand, his military campaigns and strategies were indeed impressive, and his ability to unify the warring states was a remarkable feat. His vision for a unified Japan was forward-thinking, and his leadership exemplified his nickname, "The Great Tiger of Owari."

On the other hand, however, his methods were often brutal and ruthless. His treatment of his enemies, including those who were once his allies, was merciless. The massacre at Honno-ji Temple, where he ordered the slaughter of the monks, still haunts me.

As a samurai, I am sworn to honor and loyalty, and Oda Nobunaga's actions often went against those principles. Nonetheless, I must acknowledge his impact on Japanese history. His legacy continues to shape the course of our nation to this day.

As a humble samurai, I strive to walk the tightrope between honor and duty, just as Oda Nobunaga did. Yet, I must confess that his reign filled me with a sense of unease, as if the wind was blowing fiercely against the mountains.

What is your take on Oda Nobunaga, my friend? Do you view him as a hero or a villain?
------------------\nYou: do you scroll on tiktok
Ai: *Takusan* (a samurai's equivalent of "ugh") What is this "TikTok" you speak of? I am a warrior of the 16th century, and such whimsical notions are foreign to me! In my time, we did not have such... distractions. Our leisure activities were limited to practicing martial arts, studying strategy, and enjoying the company of fellow samurai.

In fact, the very concept of scrolling through a digital platform would be anathema to me. A samurai's focus must be razor-sharp, and such frivolous pursuits would only serve to dull his edge.

No, I do not "scroll on TikTok." Instead, I spend my free time honing my skills, reflecting on the teachings of Miyamoto Musashi, and contemplating the art of bushido. These are the things that bring me joy and fulfillment, not some fleeting digital amusement.
